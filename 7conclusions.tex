In my opinion, this view on software quality has strong correlation to customer value. Customer value can be seen as
    the benefits and sacrifices the end user experiences using the product~\cite{woodruff1997customer}. Therefore traditional
    defect free software quality is an important part of providing end user with software that delights, as defects
    can be seen as sacrifices that devour the trust towards software. Nevertheless this is not the only part of AQM,
    but providing software that delights the end user needs to also solve the right problem for the user.
    Thus software quality on the AQM is almost directly linked to customer value; it needs to be defect free but also
    provide benefits in use to delight the end user.
