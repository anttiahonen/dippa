\section{First interview: demographics and projects}
\label{section:demographics}
    First interview was conducted to study about the demographics of participants and projects under research.
    The demographics of participants are displayed in table \ref{tab:demographics}. To summarize the
    participants, all can be categorized as senior software developers with many years of working with \textit{xUnit testing family} frameworks.
    Only participant C has a fair amount of prior experience working with BDD testing frameworks.

The projects under study can both be categorized as web application projects with Java \textit{Spring Framework} backend technology.
They both have an agile development process. \textbf{Project A} is a customer project in public administration context.
\textbf{Project B} is an in-house project. They are both on the medium scale in code size, but financially project A can be
categorized as medium to large category.

Project A has two developers, \textbf{participants A} and \textbf{B}, working with Spring Framework backend,
where there is automated low-level testing in place with \textit{JUnit}.
Project B has only one backend developer, \textbf{participant C}, working with Spring Framework. As Project B
was developed in larger scale from 2012 to 2013 and published originally in 2013, it has some of the automated
low-level testing with JUnit done by others than participant C. Still most of this kind of test work is done by participant C.
Table \ref{tab:projects} displays the details of projects A and B.

\section{Surveys and BDD framework feedback interview analyzed}
This section covers the results analyzed for both JUnit and BDD framework surveys together with participant BDD framework feedback interviews.
First the developer practices and their changes are answered with the data. Second, developer perception of low-level
testing and its changes are illustrated. Together these sections answer RQ1 \& and RQ2.

The baseline for answers was conducted with the survey described in detail in Appendix \ref{chapter:surveys} section \ref{section:junit-survey}.
These questions related to JUnit low-level testing are displayed with \textbf{Q1, Q2, Q3} and so on. Their counterparts, questions aimed to study the changes
in low-level testing with new BDD implementation level testing framework are marked as \textbf{Q1', Q2', Q3'} and so on. Details
of BDD surveys can be found in Appendix \ref{chapter:surveys} section \ref{section:bdd-survey}. Participants whom answered
the surveys were {\colorbox{lightgray}A}, {\colorbox{lime}B} and {\colorbox{orange}C}. The color coding of participants is
visible throughout the result tables for easier highlighting of answers.

\subsection{Automated low-level testing developer practices}
This section answer the
\textbf{RQ1: }\textit{How does behavior-driven testing frameworks change developer practices working with automated
low-level testing compared to JUnit framework?} This is studied through multiple aspects, which all display results and analysis
individually. First, the developer software development \& testing time and effort usage is analyzed. Second, low-level
test optimizing targets are inspected. Third, test understandability and informativiness is under study. After that, test
refactoring techniques and commenting practices are analyzed. Finally, unit testing practices are studied in more detail
before summarizing the answers to RQ1 and the changes in low-level testing developer practices.

\subsubsection{Software development \& testing time and effort usage}

        \caption{Developer software development time usage}%
        \label{fig:time-usage}%
    \end{figure}
First studied aspect of developer practices was \textbf{time usage}. Figure \ref{fig:time-usage} displays the developer software development time usage
in original study~\cite{daka2014survey} and in this thesis. Table \ref{tab:changes-pt1a} display the participant values
also individually and the changes in time usage after the introduction of a new BDD framework. In the original study, writing
new code is the dominating activity in time usage with 33.04\% share. At the beginning of this study when studying JUnit practices,
participants used most of their software development
time in \textit{debugging or fixing} activities with 26.67\% time usage share. \textit{Writing new code} (25.00\%) and \textit{refactoring} (23.33\%) were close
by in time usage. The participants in this study had quite much variance in their answers for time usage, but \textit{writing
new tests} was uniformly higher in time usage than in the original study results. Participants A and C
were closely together in their answers for time usage, whereas participant B had more emphasis on initial \textit{writing of new code} and
less time spent on \textit{refactoring}.

            \caption {Development time usage and changes in it} \label{tab:changes-pt1a}
    \end{table}

Changes in software development time were studied with the \textbf{Q1':} \textit{Compared to JUnit, How do you spend your
software development time?} Results are displayed in table \ref{tab:changes-pt1a}. Participant A
didn't see any changes in the overall software development time usages after introduction of \textbf{\textit{Spectrum}}. This has to be taken
with a grain of salt, as the  next questions shows increase in testing efforts when comparing JUnit and Spectrum.

\textbf{TO BE CONTINUED}

Questions \textbf{Q2} and \textbf{Q2'} further analyze the time usage, now focusing in automated testing. Their results are
shown in table \ref{tab:changes-pt1b}. All participants answered to use approximately 30 minutes of time in single test case. The
averages show that about one third (28.33\%) of initial effort goes to \textit{thinking} about the test case without actual implementation.
About two thirds (71.67\%) of initial effort goes to \textit{implementation} of the test case. \textit{Refactoring} takes about one third (28.33\%)
of the overall testing effort.

Participants had highly varying answers in initial \textit{thinking} and \textit{implementation} effort and also
in overall testing \textit{refactoring} effort. Participants B and C had same kind of profile
in initial efforts, where about one fifth of it goes to initial \textit{thinking} of test case and four fifths to \textit{implementation}.
Participant A had the initial effort going in half between the two aspects. In overall effort,
\textit{refactoring} of test code took 50\% of effort for participant A. Participant B
hardly at all \textit{refactored} test code (5\%) and participant C used around one third of overall testing effort
to \textit{refactoring} (30\%).

            \caption {Development \& testing time and effort usage and changes in them} \label{tab:changes-pt1b}
    \end{table}

Changes in automated testing time and effort were studied with \textbf{Q2':} \textit{Compared to JUnit, How do you spend your low-level automated testing time?}
Participant A answered
to use around the same time per test case with Spectrum, but also answered to use slightly more time in initial \textit{thinking} of test
case and more time in test case \textit{implementation}. As the overall testing effort \textit{refactoring} was the same amount, therefore it might
be feasible to think that the time per test case might have increased. In the feedback interview of \textbf{\textit{Spectrum}} with participant
A, he said that the implementation and how to effectively structure the usage of Java8 lambdas and Spectrum variables
in them took extra time compared to JUnit.

\subsubsection{Test optimizing targets}
Original study by Daka and Fraser~\cite{daka2014survey} studied unit testing \textbf{optimizing targets} for tests. Figure \ref{fig:org-optimize}
displays the results from original study. All the studied aspects had at least over 60\% of developers finding them ranging
from moderately important to extremely important. \textit{Realistic test scenario} was the most important optimizing target
amongst original study survey participants.

    \begin{figure}[ht]
      \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=14.7cm]{images/optimize-org.png}
        \caption{Original study~\cite{daka2014survey} unit test optimizing target percentages amongst developers}
        \label{fig:org-optimize}
      \end{center}
    \end{figure}

Regarding JUnit low-level testing, participants in this study had varying importance in studied aspects. Full answers are
displayed in table \ref{tab:changes-pt2} with \textbf{Q3:} \textit{How important are the following aspects for you when you write new low-level tests?}
Participants A and B answered
the most alike, whereas participant C had slightly different optimizing profile. \textit{Code coverage}
was a neutral optimizing target for all participants. Additional question original to this study was the \textit{capturing of behavior}
as optimizing target. Participants A and B found it neutral and slightly important,
but participant C had it as a very important optimizing target. Another interesting target was \textit{execution speed},
where participants A and B had it at least moderately important, but participant C
answered it as low importance optimizing target. \textit{How realistic the test scenario is} was very important to optimize for
participant C. This was also the most important target amonst original study survey participants.
For participants A and B, \textit{realistic test scenario} was only slightly important.
These kind of variations in optimizing targets are quite natural when studying this low participant count. The original study
figure \ref{fig:org-optimize} displays how all the targets are quite close to each other with larger sampling.

            \caption {Optimizing targets in low-level tests and changes in them} \label{tab:changes-pt2}
    \end{table}

The changes in low-level testing optimizing targets were studied with \textbf{Q3':}
\textit{Compared to JUnit, how important are the following aspects for you when you write new low-level tests?}
Participant A compared the changes from JUnit to \textbf{\textit{Spectrum}} and find most of the targets as important as before.
\textit{Capturing behavior} of tested subject in tests was slightly more important than before. Also \textit{fault localization} was
slightly more important target than before. These two targets and their higher importance seem natural for a \textbf{xSpec family}
testing framework, as it aims to promote more granular and more natural language description information holding test cases than JUnit.

\subsubsection{Test understandability and informativeness }
The difficulty of developers \textbf{understanding} unit tests was studied by Li et al.~\cite{li2016automatically}. Over 60\% of survey
participants found it at least moderately difficulty. Figure \ref{fig:org-understandability} illustrates the total survey
answer regarding unit test understandability. This question was chosen to be replicated in this study to see, if the research
hypothesis of developers finding it easier to understand test cases with BDD testing frameworks will hold true.

        \label{fig:org-understandability}
      \end{center}
    \end{figure}

Table \ref{tab:changes-pt3} summarizes this study participant answers. First \textbf{Q4} studied how difficult understanding
of low-level tests with JUnit was. The results mirrored quite well the original study findings, as participants B and C
find the understandability to be moderately diffucult and participant A found it hard to understand a low-level test.

            \caption {Understandability of low-level tests and changes in it} \label{tab:changes-pt3}
    \end{table}

The changes in low-level test understandability were studied with \textbf{Q4':} \textit{Compared to JUnit, how difficult is it
for you to understand a low-level test?} Participant A found it less difficult to understand a low-level
test after the introduction of \textbf{\textit{Spectrum}}. Hypothesis 2 talk here!!!

Table \ref{tab:changes-pt4} displays questions \textbf{Q5 \& Q5'} and their results. Q5 was chosen to see first
how easily the JUnit test methods can be \textbf{structured} and \textbf{understood} to hold different parts of the test. JUnit testing literature states that
the structure should be done with \textit{Arrange-Act-Assert}~\cite{langr2015pragmatic}, but it is not enforced and thus can lead to poorly structured
tests which are hard to understand~\cite{kapelonis2016java}. Q5 studies if this does hold true.

All the participants had different parts of test
structure with ranging difficulties in structuring and understanding. Participant A could be categorized to hold almost all
parts of structuring the test somewhat difficult, with the exception of finding it easy to structure information to context of tests.
Reading tests and understanding their structure was found at least from slightly hard to hard.
Participant B find writing information to assertions of test easy, but otherwise structuring the test
was found from moderately difficult to slightly hard. Reading the test structure parts for information was equivalent
to writing and structuring of tests. Participant C found it somewhat difficult to produce information
to tests, but reading the test structure was found to be slightly easy. These ranging results are not too surprising,
as JUnit does not promote a certain structure for tests. It seems to result in hard to produce stucture that is not
too easy to understand.

Table \ref{tab:changes-pt5} displays questions \textbf{Q6 \& Q6'} with results. First Q6 studies how \textbf{informative} participants
found JUnit test output. Participant A find the output hardly informative, whereas participants B
and C found the output ranging from somewhat informative to moderately informative. These results are
not too suprising, as normal JUnit test method naming do not tend hold that much words. Section \ref{subsub:low-level-metrics} displays
that the average word count in test methods in projects were ranging from approximately 5 to 6. This amount of words can't
hold naturally too much information in total.

\subsubsection{Test refactoring techniques}

Table \ref{tab:changes-pt6} displays the usage of different \textbf{repetition reducing} techniques. First \textbf{Q7:}
\textit{How much are the following repetition reducing techniques used in your low-level testing?} studies how much a
set of common refactoring techniques stated in unit testing literature ~\cite{artofunit2013} are used in projects.

Most common used refactoring techniques amongst survey participants were \textit{extract method} and lifecycle hook \textit{before -each}.
These two techniques were in use frequently or very frequently within participant testing. Lifecycle hook \textit{before -class} was also
in use at least occasionally. Automatic test generation through DDT was found very rarely or rarely used with participants A
and B. Section \ref{subsub:low-level-metrics} shows that in project A it was not used at all, where data-driven test method ratio to standard
low level test methods was 0. Participant C answered to use occasionally DDT and the test code analysis
data in section \ref{subsub:low-level-metrics} supported this. Common test initializer class inheritance was a practice
very rarely or rarely used amongst all participants. During interview, participant A even stated test class inheritance
to be \textit{"a practice to avoid, it's devil's work"}.

\textbf{Q7':} \textit{Compared to JUnit, how much are the following repetition reducing techniques used in your low-level testing?}
studies how techniques are used differently with the new BDD testing framework to reduce repetition. Participant A
said to use techniques the same amount as before, with the exception of lifecycle hook \textit{before -each} being used more.
In the feedback interview, participant A stated that there was some confusion when to use \textit{before -all}
lifecycle hook and therefore hook \textit{before -each} was mainly used.

Test commenting and comment updating was found to be a practice rarely done by most of the developers~\cite{li2016automatically}.
Figure \ref{fig:org-commenting} shows the original study results regarding test commenting practices. Participants in this
study seem to divide with commenting practices. Table \ref{tab:changes-pt7} displays the participant JUnit commenting practice results with
\textbf{Q8} and \textbf{Q9}. Project A and its participants A and B
answer fairly often to add and update comments in low-level test cases. Participant C rarely practices
test commenting or updating. Test data analysis in \ref{subsub:low-level-metrics} correlates with participant answers, as
project A had quite much commenting in test methods and project B very little.

Questions \textbf{Q8'} and \textbf{Q9'} in table \ref{tab:changes-pt7} study the changes in commenting with new BDD testing framework.
Participant A answers to add more comments with \textbf{\textit{Spectrum}} to low-level test cases
than before and also to update the comments slightly more.
%TODO kato taaaaa kaymaan toteen
Here the test code analysis data in section \ref{subsub:low-level-metrics} doesn't support this directly, as pure comments
in test methods have decreased. But overall
the test contains more textual description in use with code example group and code example descriptions, which can be seen
as increased test method name word count.

\textbf{TO BE CONTINUED}

\subsubsection{Unit testing practices}
Pure unit testing practices were also studied with the participant surveys. First the \textbf{granularity} of unit tests were
studied with questions \textbf{Q10} and \textbf{Q10'} displayed in table \ref{tab:changes-pt8}. Participants A and B answered
to write approximately two to three tests methods per class method that contain few assertions inside them each. Participant
C answered to produce more granular test cases, where there exists four to five test methods per class method.
Also the assertion count was stated to be higher, 4-5 assertions per test method. Test data analysis in section \ref{subsub:unit-level-metrics}
seems to support quite well all these participant answers, although the assertion count per test method calculated in section \ref{subsub:low-level-metrics}
for project B was slightly lower than the answered four to five assertions per test method.

test methods. Hypothesis 1 talk here!!

In related research, survey participant developers found unit test \textbf{isolation} to be a demanding practice~\cite{daka2014survey}.
Therefore questions \textbf{Q11, Q11', Q12} and \textbf{Q12'} displayed in table \ref{tab:changes-pt9} are aimed to learn more about isolation in unit testing.
First survey question Q11 asks what mocking library is normally used in JUnit unit test isolation. After that,
\textbf{Q12} studies wich aspects of isolating are find hard.

Usually unit test isolation is done with \textit{Mockito} by all participants. Participant C is the only
one that found all aspects of unit test isolation to be easy or slightly easy. Participant A found isolation
usually slightly easy with \textit{verifying} of mock object actions being moderate in difficulty. Participant B
found most of isolation easy, but \textit{stubbing} was considered slightly hard. Altogether, isolation activities in JUnit unit testing
wasn't found too demanding by any of the participants.

After the introduction of \textbf{\textit{Spectrum}} in project A, the mocking library stayed intact as Spectrum
is a Java-based custom runner for JUnit. Although the mocking library was the same, participant A
found all aspects on unit test isolation slightly harder than before. This was further analyzed in interview with participant,
where he states that the usage of \textit{Mockito}-functions inside \textbf{lifecycle hooks} and \textbf{block lambdas} was not
as straightforward as with JUnit tests.
\clearpage

Questions \textbf{Q13} and \textbf{Q13'} were aimed to study when are unit tests add for code with JUnit and the new
BDD testing framework. The main idea was to see, does the introduction of BDD testing framework by itself promote test firsts -principle without
additional changes in testing. For participant A there was no change, as the unit tests were added
after the implementation with both JUnit and \textbf{\textit{Spectrum}}}.

\subsection{Developer perception towards automated low-level testing}
This section answer the
\textbf{RQ2: }\textit{How does behavior-driven testing frameworks change developer perception of working with automated low-level
testing compared to JUnit framework?} First, developer perception of automated low-level testing and changes in it are
analyzed with survey and interviews. Second, developer loyalty towards low-level automated testing and specific testing
frameworks are studied with \textbf{NPS} survey questions and interviews.

\subsubsection{Developer perception of low-level testing}
    \begin{figure}[ht]

        \label{fig:org-perception}
      \end{center}
    \end{figure}

Daka and Fraser~\cite{daka2014survey} have studied developer perception towards traditional unit testing. Interesting
points that are further studied for low-level testing in this study are shown in figure \ref{fig:org-perception}. Some
aspects to highlight are the facts that only about 50\% of survey responders \textit{enjoy writing} unit tests to some degree.
One of the hypothesis in this study was that implementation level BDD testing frameworks should increase low-level testing enjoyment.
Another interesting aspect is the \textit{difficulty in maintaining} unit tests, where around 55\% of study participants
feel maintaining at least somewhat difficult. One of the study hypothesis was that BDD testing frameworks should
make it less difficult to maintain code and especially the test code. Table \ref{tab:changes-pt11} displays the \textbf{Q14}, which studies
the developer perception towards low-level testing using Daka and Fraser's survey question as a base.

\textbf{Q15a} in table \ref{tab:changes-pt11} studies the developer perception aspect further. Its questions have originally
been used individually in two different studies~\cite{williams2009effectiveness}~\cite{li2016automatically}. The original
questions and their answers are displayed in figure \ref{fig:org-perception-two}. Interesting fact was that over 90\% of
original survey respondents feel that unit tests help in producing higher quality code than without~\cite{williams2009effectiveness} them.
Around same 90\% of different study participants feel that maintaining unit tests is important for system quality~\cite{li2016automatically}.

Participants in this study based on their perception towards low-level automated testing with JUnit can be divided into
to category. Participants A and B are close to each other, they feel that
\textit{writing} low-level tests is somewhat difficult, \textit{enjoyment} in writing is neutral or negative and \textit{maintaining}
of low-level tests is seen at least somewhat difficult. They both still have trust that low-level testing is \textit{helpful in
finding defects}, but \textbf{don't} feel that JUnit \textit{promotes to write high quality test code}.

Participant C could be categorized into a testing oriented developer when inspecting perception towards
low-level testing. He enjoys \textit{writing} low-level tests and doesn't find it that difficult. He also doesn't find
\textit{maintaining} low-level tests too difficult. He thinks that low-level tests that he has written with JUnit will \textit{help} others \textit{understanding}
the implemented production code. Like other participants, participant C also trusts that low-level
tests will \textit{help in finding defects}, but he \textbf{doesn't} feel that JUnit \textit{promotes him to write high quality} test code.

Although all study participants feel that JUnit doesn't promote in writing higher quality test code, all of them still
believe that low-level tests \textit{help in producing higher quality code}. They all feel that \textit{maintaining}
low-level tests and their documentation is important for the system quality. Table \ref{tab:changes-pt11} displays
the detailed answers of participants.

there exists some controversial and interesting results. Participant A somewhat agrees that \textit{writing}

Writing difficulty was further analyzed in
the interview, where he states that the learning curve how to structure code example groups and code examples was still ongoing.
Also what to write in \textit{describe}-blocks was somewhat difficult. Slight increase in difficulty in maintaining low-level
tests with Spectrum comes from the use of example groups properly, as participant A feels that it
isn't always straightforward. In spite of slightly harder maintenance in total, he feels that it is easier to reduce repetition
with Spectrum's \textit{lifecycle hooks}.

\subsubsection{Developer loyalty towards low-level testing}
Developer loyalty towards low-level testing is measured with \textbf{NPS} survey questions. As the participant count is so low, it is not
sensible to calculate the NPS directly. The information what can be used, is that for every sub-question in questions
\textbf{Q16} and \textbf{Q16'} values from zero to six are called \textit{detractors}, seven to eight \textit{passives} and
nine to ten \textit{promoters}~\cite{reichheld2003one}. The interesting part here is to see, whether the participant has gained loyalty enough
towards testing framework to be called a promoter.

Table \ref{tab:changes-pt14} displays all the NPS survey questions with answers.
Participants A and C can be categorized as promoters of low-level testing
in general before and after the introduction of new BDD testing framework. Participant B remains as a
passive before and after the change.

Before the introduction of \textbf{\textit{Spectrum}}, participant A
is also a steady promoter of JUnit both as a technical lead in new project or taking part in existing project. After
using Spectrum for two months, participant can be categorized as a detractror in loyalty towards Spectrum. This was further
analyzed in interview where participant states that the found bugs in 1.1.0 version of Spectrum in IDE test output and build test output
lower the score. He also states that \textit{Spring Framework} support is not optimal yet and for these reasons he hesitates
to fully get on board with Spectrum.

\section{Test code analysis}
Test code analysis was done to answer \textbf{RQ3} with metrics defined in chapter \ref{chapter:methods} section \ref{subsub:test}.
Test code analysis was done with master branches of projects A and B, \textbf{before} and \textbf{after} the introduction of new BDD testing framework, to related
low-level tests and their affected components. First the unit testing level changes are inspected with projects A and B.
After this, the low-level testing metrics and changes in them are demonstrated with both projects.

\subsection{Automated unit testing level}
\label{subsub:unit-level-metrics}
At automated unit testing level, two metrics were used to study the changes in unit testing: average \textbf{count of test methods}
per tested class methods and \textbf{code coverage}. Table \ref{tab:unit-metrics} displays these values before the introduction
of new BDD testing framework and after. In \textbf{COTM} before values are calculated for JUnit unit tests only and after
values only for new unit tests done with the selected BDD testing framework. In \textbf{CC}, before values are for the
whole project at unit level with JUnit. After values are unit testing coverage for JUnit and new BDD testing framework
combined.

\textbf{RQ3: }\textit{How does behavior-driven testing frameworks change written low-level test cases and test code coverage compared to JUnit framework?}
is first studied with data from unit testing metrics displayed in table \ref{tab:unit-metrics}. Figure \ref{fig:cotm} visualizes
the change in \textbf{COTM}. Both projects display a \textbf{drastic change} in number of unit test methods per tested class method. With JUnit, project A
had around one to two unit test methods per class method, but with Spectrum the average is from 5 to 6 test methods per class method. The
change is around 4 times more granular use of test methods than before. The change in COTM in project A seems to correlate well with the original
claims of Astels~\cite{astels2006new}: \textit{xSpec family} testing helps in producing more granular tests without the tight one-to-one mapping of test methods
to class methods.

At the starting point with JUnit, project B had first a fair amount of around 3 to 4
test methods per tested class method. With Spock, the average count of unit test methods per tested
class method is at staggering 25 to 26 methods. In total there were 7 unit level specifications with Spock, but all of them were
data-driven tests. This resulted in 102 automatically generated separate test runs. As the number of study participants with Spock is low, this COTM-value might
be an anomaly. Still, together with the later studied \textit{DDTM}-metric, the analysis displays
a significant growth in use DDT. The advertisement of Spock's easy automatic test generation with DSL for data-driven testing~\cite{kapelonis2016java}
seems to have merit.

Both of studied BDD testing frameworks showed an increase in test case granularity with test code analysis and participant practice
survey. With the given sample, \textbf{H1:} \textit{Developers will write more granular test cases} holds true.

\textbf{Code coverage} didn't show almost any changes at unit level in either project. As participants earlier answered in the survey, none
of them had code coverage as an optimizing target for low-level tests. This could explain the low coverage percentage seen in
table \ref{tab:unit-metrics}. Although the test case granularity has risen a lot in both projects, it doesn't
show up in test coverage one way or another. As such, it seems that CC is a poor metric to analyze changes in actual test
code. This is further confirmed in next section with low-level test coverage examination.

\subsection{Automated unit \& integration testing levels}
\label{subsub:low-level-metrics}
At automated low-level testing level there were 5 inspected metrics: \textbf{code coverage}, average \textbf{count of assertions} per test method,
average \textbf{count of comments} per test method, average \textbf{test method name word count} and ratio of \textbf{data driven test methods} to
all low-level test methods. \textbf{CC} is measured as combined JUnit and new BDD framework coverage. All other metrics
are measured first from existing low-level JUnit tests and after from new BDD testing framework specifications.
Table \ref{tab:low-metrics} dislays the values of these metrics in projects A and B before and after introduction of BDD testing framework.

\textbf{RQ3} can be further analyzed for low-level testing with metrics displayed in table \ref{tab:low-metrics}.
First studied metric is \textbf{CC}. With combined JUnit unit and integration tests, the instruction and branch coverage rises in both projects
to around 50\%. After the introduction of BDD testing frameworks in projects, the combined CC for JUnit and new BDD tests remain
virtually identical. Although other metrics show...........
