\chapter{Surveys}
\label{chapter:surveys}
This appendix explains in detail the two surveys used in this case study: their questions and relationship to related
research surveys \& found problems. First the survey regarding JUnit is examined, followed by the inspection of BDD testing
framework survey.
\section{Survey regarding JUnit in automated low-level testing}
\label{section:junit-survey}
Survey regarding JUnit contains base questions from multiple previous research studies~\cite{williams2009effectiveness}~\cite{daka2014survey}~\cite{li2016automatically}.
They were used as base to see how the participants in this study are positioned related to other studied practitioners.
Related research in chapter \ref{chapter:background} section \ref{section:research} highlighted findings from previous studies.
This survey is aimed to study about the participants practices and perception related to common problems and other findings found in earlier research.
Table \ref{tab:junit-survey} displays how JUnit survey questions are related to previous studies and to which research questions
they will later help answering:

Tables \ref{tab:junit-pt1}, \ref{tab:junit-pt2} and \ref{tab:junit-pt3} display all the questions in the JUnit survey.
They contain multiple copied questions from other
studies. All the copied questions originally had the word \textit{'unit'} in them instead of \textit{'low-level'}. This change
was made to accompany both unit and integration testing into the survey of this study.

First copied questions are questions \textbf{Q1:} \textit{How do you spend your software development time?} and
\textbf{Q3:} \textit{How important are the following aspects for you when you write new low-level tests?}~\cite{daka2014survey}.
These questions were copied to study as a base how the development time is used and what aspects are priortized in low-level testing.
Q3 Subquestions 1 and 3-8 are originals. Q3 Subquestion 2 is added to this survey to study the initial attitude towards describing behavior
in tests.

Third copied question is \textbf{Q4:} \textit{How difficult is it for you usually to understand a low-level test?}~\cite{li2016automatically}.
This question was added to survey to get a general concensus about understandability of the low-level testing within participants.
Fourth and fifth copied questions are \textbf{Q8:} \textit{How often do you add/write documentation comments to low-level test cases?} and
\textbf{Q9:} \textit{When you make changes to low-level tests, how often do you comment the changes (or update existing comments)?}~\cite{li2016automatically}.
These questions were copied to study the low-level testing documentation practices.

Sixth and seven copied questions are \textbf{Q14 \& Q15:} \textit{Please indicate your level of agreement with the following statements}.
Q14 and its subquestions 1-5 are copied from \textit{"A survey on unit testing practices and problems"} by Daka and Fraser~\cite{daka2014survey}.
Subquestions 6-8 are original questions defined in this thesis. Q15 subquestion 1 is copied from a unit test practitioner
survey done at Microsoft~\cite{williams2009effectiveness} and subquestion 2 is copied from unit test documentation
practices survey by Li et al.~\cite{li2016automatically}. Questions Q14 \& Q15 were copied to gather developer perception
towards low-level testing.

\section{Survey regarding BDD testing framework in automated low-level testing}
\label{section:bdd-survey}
Survey regarding BDD testing framework was aimed for the projects A and B explained in chapter \ref{chapter:projects}. This means
that for project A, the survey was aimed at to study the differences between JUnit and \textit{xSpec family} testing done with \textbf{\textit{Spectrum}}.
For project B, survey was targeted to study the change from JUnit to \textit{Gherkin family} \textbf{\textit{Spock}} testing framework.
BDD testing framework survey questions together with base JUnit survey questions are used to answer to researh questions
RQ1 and RQ2. Table \ref{tab:bdd-survey} demonstrates how BDD testing framework survey questions are related to previous research findings
and research questions in this thesis:

Questions marked with '-character are direct comparison questions to question with same number in JUnit survey displayed
in section \ref{section:junit-survey}. For example original question \textbf{Q2} in JUnit survey:
\textit{"How do you spend your low-level automated testing time?"} has its direct comparison question \textbf{Q2'}:
\textit{"Compared to JUnit, How do you spend your low-level automated testing time?"}. Although there were individual surveys
used for each Spock and Spectrum, their questions are both displayed in same tables. The only change is in the words
\textit{Spectrum/Spock}, which are marked in questions. Full questions used in BDD surveys are displayed in tables \ref{tab:spock-spectrum-pt1},
\ref{tab:spock-spectrum-pt2}, \ref{tab:spock-spectrum-pt3} and \ref{tab:spock-spectrum-pt4}.
